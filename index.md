# Description

Learn and explore the fascinating world of computer programming. The goal of
the course is to help students develop programming, mathematical and
problem-solving skills. The course may also inspire some students to choose
programming as their future career.

By the end of the course, a student is expected

1. to analyze simple daily work processes
2. to see automation possibilities in the process or their parts
3. to describe the problem and its desired solution using specification of the
   software requirements
4. to implement solutions to simple problems.

# Overview

The course covers the following topics and more:

 * introduction to computers
 * file and directory manipulation
 * version control systems
 * the structure of a program
 * control structures
 * basic data types and structures
 * functions
 * modules
 * software testing
 * binary logic
 * sets
 * machine representation of data structures
 * input/output interfaces
 * files and file systems
 * databases
 * command line interfaces
 * software development models
 * documentation
 * algorithm complexity
 * machine learning
 * security
 * web applications
 * user intefaces
 * mobile development
 * cross compilation

During the course we will use [the Go programming language](https://golang.org)
as a tool to teach programming concepts.

# Prerequisites

Course materials are hosted from [GitHub](https://github.com/). Students have
to [create](https://github.com/join) (or use an existing one) a GitHub account
and share the account name with the course instructors.

Furthermore, the following software is required for participating in the
course:

 * [git+bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Git is a version control
   system. Bash is a Unix shell. Bash needs to be installed together with Git
   in Windows operating system. You don't need to install Bash if you are using
   Linux or Mac OS operating systems. For installation instructions, check [this
   video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06_FZjebjEE).
 * [Go programming language distribution](https://golang.org/): Go is a
   programming language. For installation instructions, check [this
   video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsucQCV-0x0).
*  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Visual Studio Code
   is a code editor. [Go
   extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)
   has to be installed from the Visual Studio Code. Check [the
   video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPhEB0bUQkc) for installation instructions.

Furthermore, students exercise their file and directory manipulation skills
using [file://maniac](https://born-frustrated.itch.io/filemaniac) game.
